Hi, 

I’m Ralph; I've been working as a software developer since 2006. This account is for my hobby projects & as such you won't find anything terribly immpressive here; mostly older forks of other people's repos or small experiments in 6502 Assembly language, Common Lisp, C, and Forth. I'm using [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/puff-the-magic-dragon) for new repos and may be migrating some old ones across too. 

<!---
r-moeritz/r-moeritz is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
