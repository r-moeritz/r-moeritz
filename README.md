Hi, 

I’m Ralph; I've been working as a software developer since 2006. This account is for my hobby projects & as such you won't find anything terribly immpressive here; mostly small experiments in 6502 Assembly language, Common Lisp, C, and Forth. Sometimes I fork other people's repos and make small changes for my own benefit and don't create pull requests. Sometimes I straight up upload other people's old code which I feel is worth preserving. In such cases I do attribute and make it clear the code isn't mine.

You can send me a DM on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/senilefelines.bsky.social) if you're into any of the following and want to chat:

- Retro computing and gaming, esp. A2600, C64, NES, PCE, SMD
- Obscure/interesting programming languages, esp. Forth, Common Lisp, Smalltalk
- 6502 Assembly language
- Chess
